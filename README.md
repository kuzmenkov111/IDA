A repo to research and implement techniques for intelligent data analysis (IDA). Here IDA is a generic term that covers machine learning, statistical analysis, data mining, statistical learning, predictive analytics, econometrics, actuarial modelling ...

R is used to implement these techniques using the following wrappers or frameworks: 
- [mlr](http://berndbischl.github.io/mlr/tutorial/html/index.html) package ([GitHub repo](https://github.com/berndbischl/mlr))
- [caret](http://topepo.github.io/caret/index.html) package ([GitHub repo](https://github.com/topepo/caret))
- [forecast](https://www.otexts.org/fpp/2/a) package for time series analysis ([GitHub repo](https://github.com/robjhyndman/forecast))

Some of the outputs are going to be shared in [my blog](http://jaehyeon-kim.github.io/).
